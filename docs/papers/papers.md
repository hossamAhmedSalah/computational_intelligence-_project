8. An Evolutionary Algorithm with Crossover and Mutation for Model-Based Clustering
    - 2021
    - This paper introduces an evolutionary algorithm (EA) as an alternative to the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation in model-based clustering. The EA utilizes both crossover and mutation to explore the fitness landscape, offering an efficient approach to "hard" model-based clustering. The algorithm's performance is illustrated on several datasets and compared to other clustering approaches.

11. Clustering-Based Multi-objective Immune Optimization Evolutionary Algorithm
    - 2012
    - This paper proposes a new artificial immune system (AIS)-based framework focusing on distributed and self-organization characteristics for multi-objective optimization problems. The population of solutions is decomposed into sub-populations forming clusters, which undergo independent evolution processes. The mechanism aims to reduce complexity, enhance exploitation ability, and achieve quick convergence.
