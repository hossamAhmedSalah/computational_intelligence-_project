Clustering-Based Customer Segmentation with CI/EC Algorithms

# âœ… Breif To-Do

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Define the Project
- [ ] Clarify the goal: CI/EC-based customer clustering for segmentation.
- [x] Choose or simulate a suitable dataset with numerical features.
- [ ] Conduct a literature review (6 relevant academic papers).

## ðŸ§  2. Design the Approach
- [ ] Select 6 CI/EC algorithms for evolving cluster centers.
- [ ] Define problem as an optimization task with a clear objective function.
- [ ] Outline algorithm components (representation, fitness, operators, etc.).

## ðŸ’» 3. Implement & Run Experiments
- [ ] Preprocess the data (cleaning, scaling).
- [ ] Implement CI/EC algorithms and a baseline (e.g., k-means).
- [ ] Run each algorithm 30 times using different random seeds.
- [ ] Track performance using clustering metrics (e.g., Silhouette Score).

## ðŸ“Š 4. Analyze & Compare Results
- [ ] Evaluate performance of all algorithms and settings.
- [ ] Tune parameters and analyze impact (mutation, population, etc.).
- [ ] Optional: Apply techniques to maintain solution diversity.

## ðŸŽ¨ 5. Visualize & Demonstrate
- [ ] Generate visualizations (scatter plots of clusters).
- [ ] Build a basic user interface to select algorithms and view results.

## ðŸ“‘ 6. Document & Present
- [ ] Write the final report covering all aspects: intro, methods, results.
